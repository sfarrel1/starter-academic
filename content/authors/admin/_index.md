I am a third year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rice Uiversity. I am part of the Rice Computational Imaging Lab and advised by Dr. Ashok Veerargahvan. 

I am interested in developing and testing joint communication and imaging systems in the radio frequency and millimeter wave bands. Specifically, I study distributive networked wireless imaging and its applications in the next generation of communication networks. My goal is to combine computational imaging techniques, optimization and data-driven models with wireless communication infrastructure to introduce novel sensing and security applications.
